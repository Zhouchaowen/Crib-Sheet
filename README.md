# 八股 Crib Sheet 📄

> A compact and pragmatic "crib sheet" for tech interviews, full of standard answers, classic patterns, and boilerplate wisdom — aka the programmer's 八股文.

## 🧠 What is "八股"?

In ancient China, "八股文" (Bāgǔ wén) was a rigid essay format used for imperial exams — highly structured, formulaic, and focused on the classics.  
In today's tech world, we programmers have our own version of it:  
**Reciting HashMap internals, listing TCP/IP layers, and explaining volatile vs synchronized — all from memory.**  
This is the modern 八股.

This repo embraces it.

Not to mindlessly repeat it — but to **master the fundamentals, internalize the patterns**, and eventually break free from them.

## 📚 What's Inside

- 🔑 Core concepts (OS, networking, DB, etc.)
- 🔍 Common interview questions with “standard answers”
- 🧾 Summarized design patterns and system design bullets
- 💡 Tips, gotchas, and mental models
- 🧪 Occasional code snippets to reinforce ideas

## 🤔 Why a Crib Sheet?

Because time is short, interviews are brutal, and sometimes you just want a **well-organized little scroll of wisdom** to scroll through on your phone.

No fluff, no distractions — just distilled 八股精华.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- [x] Data Structures & Algorithms
- [x] Golang
- [x] OS / Networking
- [x] MySQL / Redis / MQ
- [x] System Design
- [x] Common "HR traps" & how to handle them

## 🧭 How to Use

- Before interviews — cram it
- Between jobs — refresh it
- While coding — reference it
- Long-term — improve it (PRs welcome!)
